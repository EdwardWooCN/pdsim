# PDSim

What is PDSim?

* A python/cython-based library for Positive-Displacement machine Simulation
* Written in a flexible way so that a wide variety of machines can be implemented with the same core. 
* Two papers about PDSim are available. Please see our papers in Int. J. Refrig.:
    * [PDSim: A general quasi-steady modeling approach for positive displacement compressors and expanders](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2019.09.002) preprint: [preprints/PaperI.pdf](doc/papers/PaperI.pdf)

This version uses CoolProp v6.x
